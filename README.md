#ML Kit Features
There are two ways of using ML Kit:

On-device. These features have been enhanced to not only interpret still images, but you can also run ML against a live camera feed. Why? Because it's fr***ing cool!
Cloud. The cloud has much larger and always up to date models, so results will be more accurate. Since this is a remote service reconition speed depends heavily on the size of the images you send to the cloud.
